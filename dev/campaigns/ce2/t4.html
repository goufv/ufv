                        <h2>Teisha: Continuing to Find Her Passion</h2>
                        <p>Following a family tragedy, Teisha decided it was time to transition into a career to support her family. She was ready to further her education but unable to study full-time, so UFV CE felt like a perfect fit. When she  discovered the Activity Assistant program, Teisha not only found a new career but a new passion as well. Supportive instructors and a close-knit group of students made Teisha’s experience transformational—and even today she and her classmates continue to share ideas and information.</p>

                        <p>Liam knew he needed to find a clear career path—and enrolling in UFV’s Public Relations Certificate program immediately felt like a fit. He credits his instructors and course materials with igniting his interest and recalls how his in-office work experience brought his new profession to life. “My practicum experience at the City of Abbotsford was great,” Liam says, recalling his particular excitement around the City’s partnership with the Vancouver Canucks. His PR certificate and Associate Arts degree have now equipped him to advance this new career with clear direction.</p>

                        <p>Ask her how she feels about her job and Kaitlyn will sing its praises: “I adore where I work.” She credits UFV’s Veterinary Administrative Assistant program with helping her discover the right career path for her, and to have enabled her to secure her current position in a veterinary hospital. Thanks to “incredible teachers and students” in her class, she says that UFV CE has “changed my career for the best … I am in a career I love, and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>
