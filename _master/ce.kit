                        <h2>Katie: Continuing to Build a Life for Her Family</h2>
                        <p>Before registering at UFV, Katie worked as a hotel maid “making minimum wage as a young,
                            Indigenous, single mom.” After completing the Legal Admin Assistant program, she was able to
                            work in the field for a few years—and is now also completing the Paralegal program. "I never
                            would have been able to work in this field if it weren’t for my education at UFV," she says.
                            “I never thought I could be where I am today, but with a little bit of faith and a lot of
                            hard work, I’m very successful in my life and my career—I was even able to purchase my own
                            home for my kids— and it is all because I chose to further my education.”</p>

                        <h2>Alison: Continuing Her Lifelong Learning</h2>
                        <p>As a self-described “lifelong learner,” Alison signed up for, and completed her Public
                            Relations Certificate—while also working towards her Bachelor's Degree. She is now working
                            in the aerospace sector, providing media liaison support to her team. For Alison, program
                            flexibility was one of the key reasons for her achievements. “The programs can be easily
                            integrated into my life,” she notes, and have allowed her to successfully balance full-time
                            work, personal and family commitments, alongside her education.</p>

                        <p>For Jaspreet, an education in Human Resources Management has provided her with more than just
                            training and certification. “The programs have given me opportunities to face obstacles and
                            taught me how to celebrate the success of others,” she says. “UFV has provided me with the
                            two most important qualities that I can possess: knowledge and confidence.” She now says her
                            “forever goal” is to grow and learn, and to continue to accept new challenges in her career.
